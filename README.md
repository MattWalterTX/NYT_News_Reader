<!-- PROJECT OVERVIEW -->

## Project Overview

### Learning Goals
<h4>Take-Home</h4>

The take-home is meant to simulate a task that you might receive during an interview process. The scope is smaller scale and open ended. The goal is to complete the task in 8 hours or less. Since there is a time limit and due to the tasks open ended nature, you should manage your time and plan appropriately. Not only is completing the take-home necessary, but also explaining your process and reasoning behind your decisions are equally important. Use this challenge to practice speaking about your planning and decision making processes around the code you write.
<br>

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

NY Times News Reader
<br>

You will create a news reader application that pulls articles from the New York Times API Top Stories API.

Requirements:
At a minimum, you must show:

* A list of articles
* A “detailed” view for each article (as opposed to summary/list view)
* Articles in the list must link to the detailed article view you create
* Some sort of search, filter, OR sort

This was great exposure to how a take home challenge for the job hunt will be! It was interesting to work with a different time constraint. I had some issues that I did not think that would eat up the amount of time they did, which was frustrating. But the good side is that it reminded me that I have to keep up with my fundamentals no matter how many new technologies I learn.
